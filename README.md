## Idea:

This project was just a fun little idea to use in practice some of the technologies that i've learned over the course taught by Joel Turnbell.

## Objective:

The objective of this application is to be able to copy an entire "Software Engineer" specific job board application information and paste it within this job translator application to find the realsitic result the company is looking for.

This was a fun little project inspired by an old friend and a small community on the internet, the intention of this application is just for a laugh.

## Adzuna API

I was able to integrate the Adzuna API thankfully without much trouble, there was issues when retrieving the data due to its format which was resolved with some regex.

I've limited the API callout search to 20 random jobs within the Australian region, I also added a random description selector with so it would sample 1 of the 20 returned descriptions on each buttonClick.
